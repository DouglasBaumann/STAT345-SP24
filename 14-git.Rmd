## Why Version Control?

"The person who knows the most about your code is you-six-months-ago, and you-six-months-ago are not replying to your emailed questions."
-Anon.

## Why Version Control?

The features of version control:

- Complete record of changes allowing you to, e.g., revert back to a previous version of your code if things have gone awry.
- Store messages for every change, so that you can recall the rationale for a change later.
- With, e.g., `Git`, you can back your code remotely (e.g., on `GitHub`), allowing for easy distribution.
- Facilitates collaboration; changes can be developed independently and merged together.

Version control tools were designed for "code", but are useful for all sorts of files

## Git Basics

`Git` allows you to take "snapshots" of the contents of a folder on your machine as you make changes to them. 

- Fix a bug? Take a snapshot. 
- Add functionality? Take a snapshot. 

These snapshots are dubbed *commits*. Snapshot details are stored in the subfolder `.git`.

## Github

+ "Centralized" version control: use Github as the canonical "copy" of the repository
+ Common host for R packages: `devtools::install_github()`
+ Bug tracker: Github Issues

## Obtain a Github Account

If you do not have a `GitHub` account, get one at `github.com`.

- This will be part of your lab/homework!
- I recommend using an email address that ISN'T your uwlax.edu email (you're going to graduate!)

## Install Git

If you do not have `Git` installed on your laptop, install it!

- Linux: Use your package manager
- Mac: `Git for Mac` (at https://git-scm.com/downloads) or via `homebrew` (`brew install git`)
- Windows: `Git for Windows` (at https://git-scm.com/downloads)

During setup, configure Git with your user name (use your full name, not your UWL ID) and your user email (which should be the same one you used to sign up for your GitHub account).

## A couple of security steps

In your Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Macs), enter the following:

`git config --global user.name "your_username" `

`git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com" `

```{r eval=FALSE}
# https://gist.github.com/Z3tt/3dab3535007acf108391649766409421
usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "YourName", user.email = "your@mail.com")
usethis::create_github_token() 
credentials::set_github_pat("YourPAT")
#gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

## GitHub First...

For this lecture, we will follow the paradigm of "GitHub first".

- What this means is that when we create a repository, we will create it on GitHub first, then link a local repository to it from
inside **RStudio**.

In GitHub, do the following:

- go to the top-level directory (i.e., `github.com/&lt;your user name&gt;`)
- click on "+" at top right, and select "New repository"
- name the repository (e.g., "STAT-345-S24")

## GitHub First...

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("github1.png")
```

## GitHub First...

- provide a short description of the repository (don't leave completely blank!)
- keep the repository public (as students you have access to free private repos https://education.github.com/pack, but for purposes of this lecture keep the repo public)
- click on "Initialize this repository with a README"...there is no need to "Add .gitignore" or "Add a license"
- click on "Create Repository"

## GitHub First...

```{r echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("github2.png")
```

## ...then RStudio

In **RStudio**, do the following:

- click on ` File`. then `New Project...`
- click on "Version Control", then on "Git"
- provide the *full* address for the "Repository URL" (including the `https`, etc.; by default, this will provide the name of your local repository)
- make sure "Create project as subdirectory of:" points to where you want to point it (your course or homework folder, for example)
- click on "Create Project"

## ...then RStudio

At this point, you should find that your `Files` pane (bottom right by default) is listing the files in your local repository, including one ending in `.Rproj` and the `README.md` file that was created on `GitHub`.

## Commits

Commits are lists of file changes

+ new lines
+ modified lines
+ deleted lines

The current state of your project is just the accumulated set of file changes over time.

## Updating Your Repository

To, e.g., add a new file to your local repository, do the following:

- open the new file as you always would (as an R Script, an
  R Markdown file, etc.)
- fill the file with "stuff"
- save the file...at this point, the file name should show up in the Git pane next to an "M" symbol (for modified)
- continue to modify the file, or...stage the file for a commit by clicking on "Staged" in the Git pane
- click on "Commit" in the Git pane
- in the new window that opens, add a "Commit message", then click on the "Commit" button
- click on "Push" to push your changes from your local repo to your GitHub repo

Done.

## Commit Messages

Commit messages exist for your benefit:

+ One line summary of changes
+ Longer explanation if necessary

Remember that the reader (usually you) will not have full context

## What should I commit?

+ Commits should be a single conceptual "change"
+ Commits should be as small as feasable while being complete
+ Ideally the project is "working" after each commit

## Advanced Git

+ branching: you can maintain "parallel" versions of your repository.
This is useful for "exploratory" work. These can later be merged into
the "main" branch.
+ bisecting: you can identify the commit responsible for introducing a
bug using binary search
+ hooks: you can automatically execute tasks based upon git behaviors;
can be used to automate testing/deployment

## Merges

In Git, two commits can be merged by applying the relevant changes one after the other.

If the changes are independent this is straightforward.

If the changes conflict it needs to be manually merged (typically due to incompatible changes).
